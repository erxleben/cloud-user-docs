# de.NBI Cloud Freiburg

Welcome to the de.NBI Cloud site Freiburg. Freiburg is offering access to cloud resources
via the [Galaxy Gateway](https://galaxyproject.org) and the [European Galaxy server](https://usegalaxy.eu).


## Site Specific Information

### Get Started - the GUI Way

The [Galaxy Training Network](https://training.galaxyproject.org) is providing more than 210 trainings, ready to use on the European Galaxy server with e-learning materials. Learn how to start workflows, how to upload thousands of datasets and group them into paired-end collections, directly interact with
ENA or SRA, or learn how to use one of our 2500 tools.

### Get Started - the API way

You can control all aspects of Galaxy via a powerful API. The most obvious use-case is to start workflows programmatically or via GitHub actions.
Learn more about Galaxy's API and especially the Python bindings, called BioBlend, in the [Galaxy Training Network]( https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/dev/tutorials/bioblend-api/slides.html#1) or play around with our [Jupyter Notebooks](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nsoranzo/bioblend-tutorial/master).

### Interactive Tools, Notebooks and Virtual Desktops

The Galaxy framework allows us to deploy some nifty things easily in the cloud. Check out https://live.usegalaxy.eu to start your Jupyter Notebook, RStudio instance
or other virtual Desktop or de.NBI projects like Wilson. All of those interactive environments can be combined with Galaxy workflows and you have access to
your Galaxy storage, called histories. This will enable you to combine the best of both worlds, the asynchronous world of workflow scheduling
and the synchronous world of Notebooks.

### Special Infrastructure for Training, Workshops and e-learning

[TIaaS (Training Infrastructure as a Service)](https://galaxyproject.eu/tiaas) is a special service offered by de.NBI Freiburg. With TIaaS
you will get for your workshop (or remote training event):

* private queue where only your trainingâ€™s jobs will run,
* no admin knowledge needed,
* official Galaxy Training Materials are guaranteed to work and regularly tested,
* your own dashboard, with information about your trainees, how they process and if they have problems in a GDPR compliant way.

TIaaS also works with the interactive tools, so you can also run your Python or R workshop inside the de.NBI cloud with Notebooks for every trainee and
no administration overhead.

### Access to de.NBI Cloud Freiburg

You can use Galaxy anonymously if you prefer, but if you want to have persistent storage and run many hundreds of
jobs in parallel, you need to create [an account](https://usegalaxy.eu/login). We recommend using ELIXIR-AAI to login.
If you have any questions, please contact us at galaxy@informatik.uni-freiburg.de.

### Storage

We provide all registered users a quota of 250 GB. You can request more storage space for a limited time by visiting https://usegalaxy.eu/quota-increase.
